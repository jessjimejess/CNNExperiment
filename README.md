# CNNExperiment

Simple code to check CNN behaviour when we put more convolutional layers

It consist in 3 classes:

-BaseConvNet: It contains train functions and data-export functions. Only train and show_model are public methods.
-StandarCNN: used to build a simple CNN whose conv. layers are defined by convolution_layers param.
-ResNet50CNN: used to build a complex resnet50 CNN.
